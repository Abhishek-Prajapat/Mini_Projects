# Flask Web app for Gender Detection

The reason for choosing the gender detection as the target was that's its the most feasible on a haar_cascade image. We could have also used other targets but for them we would need the whole person which could only be obtained in the real world using instance segmentation on the images but that would be computationaly explensive and hence we move with the haar_cascade.

To run the API just run the app.py file which will give a ip address where you can use the web-app.
